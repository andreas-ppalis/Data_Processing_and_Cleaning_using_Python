# Data Processing and Cleaning using Python

This project includes basic concepts of data processing and data cleaning using Python language. It is a worked example I have created, with a random dataset I personally made, to show some of my skills in preparing the data using the Python. The dataset is referred to a soft drink product mentioning some of its characteristics that can be helpful for further analysis.

What to expect:
- Importing of useful libraries
- Basic information on tha dataset and some statistics
- How can we deal with missing values
- Find outliers of the dataset
